# **Cabinet Fans for Cooling**

Effective cooling is critical for any network cabinet setup, and for my [Network Cabinet](../../README.md), I installed **dual 120mm AC-powered fans** to ensure proper airflow and hardware longevity.

## **The Fan Setup**

I used **two sets of dual 120mm AC-powered fans** to provide reliable and quiet cooling. These fans are positioned to optimize airflow through the cabinet, keeping all the rack-mounted equipment running at safe temperatures.

- **Shroud STL:** [Fan Shroud Design](https://makerworld.com/en/models/847148#profileId-794416)

The **3D-printed shroud** was designed to streamline airflow and securely mount the fans. It’s a straightforward design that complements the cabinet’s layout while improving cooling efficiency.
